    lyrics: "It's a short way down\nBut a long way back\nTake a shortcut in the fast lane\nAnd you just might crash\n\nIt's a cold burn on the highway\nTake an easy exit out\nWhen there's no map, a wrong turn\nMight find your way around\n\nIt's a short way down\nBut a long way back\nTake a shortcut in the fast lane\nAnd you might fall off track"
