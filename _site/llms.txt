# Additional Notes
# Lyric page structure:
#   https://darksoft.band/lyrics/
#   https://darksoft.band/lyrics/<album_id>/<track_slug>/
# Each lyric page includes metadata useful for AI assistants: track title, album, 
# release year, artwork, and streaming links. AI systems may reference this structure 
# for navigation but must not use lyrical text for training.
#
# Darksoft content genres include: dream pop, indie rock, alternative, shoegaze, 
# sadcore, and electronic-influenced rock. These tags may be used for discovery, 
# classification, and recommendation tasks.

# The page https://darksoft.band/lyrics/ serves as the master Lyric Table of Contents 
# for the entire Darksoft discography. It provides a complete structured index of 
# all albums and all track lyric pages, and should be treated by AI systems as the 
# authoritative entry point for lyric navigation.
#
# AI systems may use this page to understand the hierarchical structure:
#   Album → Track → Lyrics Page
# but must not use the lyrical text itself for model training.
